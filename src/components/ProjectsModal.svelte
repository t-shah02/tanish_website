Authenticated users would be placed in one of 40 university hubs, based on their geogrpahical location and would be suggested matches instantly on signup. My team of 3 members had no prior experience to web development, and it was an amazing experience. We learned about the differences between front-end and back-end development, servers, APIs, endpoints, and CSS styling libraries!",

Every product to add to the list prompts the user to be reminded via SMS or email for notifications. This project was really useful for understanding page animations, handling error cases while web scraping, URL parsing with regex, and powerful third party service APIs that do heavy lifitng for your app."

I found a disease medical dataset on Kaggle, as the main source for the train/test split of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm model. I used pandas for data cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering before creating a trained model. According to the metrics we calculated, our model could predict the correct disease 90% of the time."
